## Status

This project is mostly a draft by now and still under development. Feel free to
create issues on GitHub, leave feedback, or file pull requests to participate.

## Trivia

The [Latin word](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/induo#Latin) _indui_ can be
translated as "I have assumed [a part]" or "I have put on [smth]". The last *i*
is stressed and pronounced "ee", i.e., it is "in-doo-EE".
